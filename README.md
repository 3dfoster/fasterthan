# The old fasterthan.me website

The code for the previous version of my personal website. I built it using the Express framework before I really knew how to use it or its templating engine, which is why the code in `app.js` looks... the way it does. I ended up creating my own very rudimentary template engine for this website as well.

Eventually the hacky, rudimentary nature of the Node application made it harder and harder to add features, so I finally retired this version and rebuilt the site from the ground up using Express the proper way.

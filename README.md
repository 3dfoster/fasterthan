The code for the previous version of my personal website. I built it using the Express framework before I really knew how to use the framework or its templating engine, which is the code in `app.js` looks... ugly and functionally simplistic. I ended up creating my own very rudimentary template engine for this website as well.

Eventually the hacky, rudimentary nature of the website made it harder and harder to add features to my website, so I finally retired this version and rebuilt the site from the ground up using Express the proper way.

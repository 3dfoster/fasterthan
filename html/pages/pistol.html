I feel the oscillations of a thousand whirring micro engines on the hull where I rest my head, engines that power a thousand tiny thrusters on the back of the Harton and propel us forward. Up close each one looks like the lit end of a cigarette, bright during propulsion like taking a long drag after a hard day and as faint otherwise, and from afar together they look like a twinkling constellation in a corner of a night sky far removed from the noisy lights of Vilsk, and as the Harton maneuvers those stars or cigarettes or thrusters however you want to look at them twinkle, some fade in and some fade out, as the transport's brain adjusts the dynamics of propulsion and turns us left or right, up or down, to and fro, takes from one dusty place to the other. The hairs on my freshly cut head rub against the metal hull, vibrate accordingly, and tickle my scalp. Eyes closed, I dream of a distant memory, and listen to the sound of the Harton's heartbeat, a deep whoom whoom whoom over and over again, in a steady rhythm I match with my breathing.

I smell the sour, distinct smell of ammonia as it emanates from a small stack of piss bottles we keep in the corner of our little land cruiser designed and engineered from the ground up for the brutally efficient adjudication of roaches but somehow nobody kept in mind the people riding it and the reality that we piss every 2 hours just like everyone else, we being me, my guide and mentor Algarde, and the dozen other pairs of officer trainees from the Citadel beside us as we travel to the outer limits of our city Vilsk in search for those who have succumbed to the plague. We're three hours out from the city's center where the powdery white walls of our base protect us from the masses and where as students we wake, eat, train, eat, learn, eat, sleep and then repeat. I think of a girl I knew in Commons. 

"Five minutes till dropoff" the driver announces through the interlink communication system embedded within my earbone that rattles a bone in my skull and translates those vibrations to sound. I'm rustled from my meditation so I open my eyes and look at Algarde sitting on the bench attached to the hull opposite me, his light skin contrasts with the jet black of his short straight hair and the gray of his well-kept uniform. He's looking past me through one of the only two windows in the rear of the transport where us passengers go, out into the decaying, poorly maintained section of Vilsk where the sick like to hide, the concrete walls and buildings and complexes and commerce plazas and walkways and speedways all crumbling in some places but dusty and dirty and grimy everywhere. There's never any sign of life anywhere outside the main walls of Vilsk, though there used to be. Everyone lucky enough not to catch the plague that began to envelop and consume wide swathes of our population around the same time they finished construction of the new city moved in to it, and those unlucky souls that caught it were either rounded up by officers of the Citadel like me and sent to the massive treatment centers a hundred clicks outside our city, died, or scattered like cockroaches at the first light of danger and hid into the tiny crevices and crannies of the old city and eked out a meager and humble living. Today I and the rest of the trainees packed tightly into this lumbering, smelly vessel are tasked with catching these poor souls, to learn what it's like to catch a squirming, writhing human caught in the throes of a disease we don't know a cure for yet, I guess.

"Thirty seconds!" driver shouts, the excitement of danger, combat, and confrontation is laced in his voice, and it excites me too and I feel my heart pumping and it starts to feel like one of those do or die moments that don't mean much on their own but slowly one by one they either add to or detract from your strength and confidence as a man. Algarde is excited too, though he does his best not to show it, but I'm good at reading people so he doesn't fool me. His eyes twitch ever so slightly as he breaks his gaze from through the window and he turns his attention to checking the half a dozen pieces of gear strapped throughout his body. I check mine too: a first aid kit strapped my left thigh, pair of IR flares strapped to the other, net gun on my left hip, pistol on my right, extra ammo on the small of my back, and a hard box of cigarettes in my left shoulder pocket. I grab for my pistol again and remove it from its holster. I feel the cold contours of its slide and the perfectly machined grooves along its surface. I look at it from the side, admire the green blinking light that indicates it's safe and the counter on the back that tells me it has thirty rounds ready to fire. It is a tool for imposing its operator's will. I put it away and look up and notice Algarde staring at me. He looks up from the pistol and we lock eyes. "Ready to catch some roaches?" a slight, mischevious smile forming on one side of his lips.

"Ready..." the second driver says over our interlink, more to himself and his co-pilot as he arms the shock pulse he'll fire a second before we all jump out the side doors. The big motor that charges the megacapacitor that powers the pulse beacon kicks in, a thwop thwop thwop that's not very loud at first but it builds and gets louder and louder. The pulse beacon shocks anyone within a hundred feet of the Harton into submission so they are easy prey for us to pick up but that never happens because they hear and see our Harton's floating along a mile away so it's pointless but we do it every time anyways. The motor gets louder and louder, and the one on this Harton in particular begins to screech because it's so old, and it's getting louder and louder and right when I feel my mind rattle and my eyeballs shake and I can't think straight they fire the thing and the whole Harton pitches to the left as the motor stops rotating and a deep, impossibly deep, not even that loud but so deep, sound emits from what feels like a mile up but really it's just a dozen feet up where the weapon hangs on a small arm above the transport, and after this deep noise that seems to bend air waves and makes the straight lines along the metal hull look curvy a red light flashes rapidly above us and a siren goes off and wails in our ears and the two doors on either side of the slow and steady Harton open up to the outside where dust is so kicked up that I can't see anything but all the guides are screaming MOVE MOVE MOVE so I jump out with my heart pumping faster than I ever thought it could and there's a loud, constant hum in my ears as I try to make sense of my surroundings and I have this sick, lurching senation in the pit of my stomach that makes me want to vomit and my whole body feels like it's quivering and I wouldn't mind shitting myself right now either but I fight all of these emotions because I'm no coward and I have to finish this mission to graduate so in my mind I imagine I stuff all these feelings into a tiny box where they don't bother me anymore and lock it up, but I hang on to the key for now so I can complete this examination with high marks and finish the mission without losing my mind.

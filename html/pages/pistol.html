I feel the oscillations of a thousand whirring micro engines on the hull where I rest my head, engines that power a thousand tiny thrusters on the back of the Harton and propel us forward. Up close each one looks like the lit end of a cigarette, bright during propulsion like taking a long drag after a hard day and as faint otherwise, and from afar together they look like a twinkling constellation in a corner of a night sky far removed from the noisy lit sky that hangs over Vilsk, and as the Harton maneuvers those stars or cigarettes or thrusters however you want to look at them twinkle, some fade in and some fade out, as the brain of the Harton adjusts the dynamics of propulsion and turns us left or right, up or down, to and fro, and get us from one place to the other. The hairs on my freshly cut head rub against the metal hull, vibrate accordingly, and tickle my scalp. Eyes closed, I dream of a distant memory, and listen to the sound of the Harton's heartbeat, a deep whoom whoom whoom over and over again, in a steady rhythm I match with my breathing.

The smell sour ammonia emanates from the small stack of piss bottles we keep in the corner of our little land cruiser that was designed from the ground up for the adjudication of roaches but somehow nobody kept in mind the people riding it and the reality that we piss every 2 hours just like everyone else, we being me, my guide Algarde, and the dozen other pairs of officer trainees from the Citadel beside us as we travel to the outer limits of our city Vilsk in search for those who have succumbed to the sickness.

"Five minutes till dropoff" the driver announces through the interlink communication system embedded within my earbone that rattles a bone in my skull and somehow magically translates those vibrations to sound. It disturbs me from my meditation so I open my eyes and look at Algarde sitting on the bench attached to the hull opposite me, his light skin in contrast with the jet black of his short straight hair and the gray of his and mine and our dingy uniforms. He is looking past me through one of the only two windows in the aft section of the transport, out into the decaying, poorly maintained section of Vilsk where the sick like to hide, the concrete walls and buildings and complexes and commerce plazas and walkways and speedways all crumbling in some places but dusty and dirty and grimy everywhere. There's never any sign of life anywhere outside the main walls of Vilsk, though there used to be. Everyone lucky enough not to contract the sickness that began to plague wide swathes of our population around the same time they finished construction of the new city moved in to it, and the unlucky were either rounded up by officers of the Citadel like me and sent to the massive treatment centers a hundred clicks outside our city, or scattered like cockroaches at the first light of danger and hid into the tiny crevices and crannies of the old city and eked out a meager and humble living. These latter are the ones it is our mission is to catch.

"Thirty seconds!" driver shouts, the excitement of danger, combat, and confrontation is laced in his voice, and it excites me too and I feel my heart pumping and it starts to feel like one of those do or die moments that don't mean much on their own but slowly one by one these moments either adds or detracts to your strength as a man. Algarde is excited too, though he does his best not to show it, but I'm good at reading people so he doesn't fool me. His eyes twitch ever so slightly as he breaks his gaze from through the window and he turns his attention to checking the half a dozen pieces of gear strapped throughout his body. I check mine too: first aid kit of gauze and lozenge and syringes full of painkillers and more strapped to my left thigh, a pair of IR flares strapped to the other, net gun on my left hip, pistol on my right, extra ammo on the small of my back, and a hard box of cigarettes in my left shoulder pocket. Everything there and where it's supposed to be. I grab for my pistol again and remove it from its holster. I feel the cold contours of its slide and the perfectly machined grooves along its surface. I look at it from the side, admire the green blinking light that indicates it's safe and the counter on the back that tells me it has thirty rounds ready to fire. A tool for imposing its operator's will, ready and willing. I put it away and look up and notice Algarde staring at me. He looks up from the pistol and we lock eyes. "Ready to catch some roaches?" he asks, a slight, mischevious smile forming on one side of his lips.

"Ready..." the second driver says over our interlink, more to himself and his co-pilot as he arms the shock pulse he'll fire a second before we all jump out the side doors. The whoom whoom whoom of the propulsion system is drowned out by a loud steady hum from the big motor that charges the megacapacitor that powers the pulse beacon that shocks anyone within a hundred foot sphere of the blast into submission and stuns them in place so they are easy prey for us to pick up but that never happens because they hear and see our Harton's floating along a mile away so it's pointless but we do it every time anyways. The hum of the motor gets louder, and louder, and the one on this Harton in particular begins to screech because it's so old, and right when I feel my mind rattle and my eyeballs shake they fire the thing and the whole Harton pitches to the left as the motor stops rotating and a deep, impossibly deep, not even that loud but so deep, sound emits from what feels like a mile up but really it's just a dozen feet up where the weapon hangs on a small arm above the transport, and after this deep noise that seems to bend air waves and makes the straight lines along the metal hull look curvy a red light flashes rapidly above us and a siren goes off and wails in our ears and the two doors on either side of the slow and steady Harton open up to the outside where dust is so kicked up that I can't see anything but all the guides are screaming MOVE MOVE MOVE so I jump out with my heart pumping faster than I ever thought it could and there's a loud, constant hum in my ears as I try to make sense of my surroundings and I have this sick, lurching senation in the pit of my stomach that makes me want to vomit and my whole body feels like it's quivering and I wouldn't mind shitting myself right now either but I fight all of these emotions because I'm not a coward and I have an objective to complete to graduate so I imagine stuffing all these feelings into a tiny box where they don't bother me anymore and lock it but I hang on to that key for now so I can complete this examination with high marks and finish the mission without losing my mind.
